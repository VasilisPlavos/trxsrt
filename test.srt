00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:09,263
Hi, I'm Ryan Dahl. You might know me as 
the creator of Node.js.

3
00:00:09,263 --> 00:00:12,444
As a programmer, I like things that are simple.

4
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:18,000
Really simple.

5
00:00:18,925 --> 00:00:20,576
Programming should be simple. 

6
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,381
That's why I created Node.

7
00:00:23,269 --> 00:00:25,939
But these days Node is not simple.

8
00:00:26,707 --> 00:00:30,155
[siren]

9
00:00:30,459 --> 00:00:32,760
Just ask Rachel, she's been here for days.

10
00:00:32,994 --> 00:00:35,835
Setting up TypeScript is an easy 47 step process:

11
00:00:35,879 --> 00:00:42,415
first you take a TS config file [...] add an ES in front [...]
becomes a JavaScript target [...] don't forget Al Gore!

12
00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:47,000
And here's Steve commemorating the 20th test 
framework he's recently learned.

13
00:00:47,394 --> 00:00:49,106
Ahh, please be gentle!

14
00:00:50,909 --> 00:00:53,291
Okay, I'm good.

15
00:00:54,844 --> 00:00:57,508
Getting Node APIs to work in the 
browser can be...

16
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:01,650
...frustrating.  

17
00:01:01,812 --> 00:01:03,161
[crying]

18
00:01:03,848 --> 00:01:06,050
Security is also a nightmare. 

19
00:01:06,686 --> 00:01:09,334
npm packages have access to everything.

20
00:01:09,859 --> 00:01:13,116
Go, go, go! Grab everything, grab everything! Oh hey there!

21
00:01:23,289 --> 00:01:29,420
But you can be a faster, more productive developer with Deno,
the simplest way to program.

22
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:34,960
Deno comes with TypeScript, 
all-in-one tooling, and web  

23
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:38,308
standard APIs, so you can write 
once and run anywhere.

24
00:01:38,439 --> 00:01:39,167
Anywhere?

25
00:01:39,541 --> 00:01:40,304
Anywhere.

26
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:48,000
Deno is secure by default so every 
dependency doesn't have full access to your computer.

27
00:01:49,526 --> 00:01:51,105
[whoosh and shattering glass]

28
00:01:56,470 --> 00:01:59,434
And you don't have to give 
up the packages you love from npm.

29
00:01:59,636 --> 00:02:00,793
I can use Next.js?

30
00:02:01,056 --> 00:02:01,556
Yeah!

31
00:02:01,919 --> 00:02:03,449
He said I can use Next.js!

32
00:02:04,358 --> 00:02:05,325
And many more.

33
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:12,478
So join hundreds of thousands of developers using Deno

34
00:02:12,478 --> 00:02:14,764
because programming should be simple.
